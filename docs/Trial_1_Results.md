  - Quality filtering applied (score ‚â•5, views ‚â•100, proper length)
  - Document categorization working (8 categories created)
  - Relevance scoring algorithm functional
  - **Verified**: Documents table contains exactly 5,000 rows

### 4. **Embedding System** ‚úÖ (Alternative Implementation)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL (Demo Version)
- **Details**:
  - **5,000 embeddings** created successfully
  - Used feature-based approach (length, score, views, categories)
  - 8-dimensional vectors created for each document
  - **Verified**: Embedding table contains 5,000 rows with proper structure

### 5. **Core Data Structure** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL
- **Tables Created**:
  - `documents` table: 5,000 rows with full content, metadata, categories
  - `document_embeddings` table: 5,000 rows with vector representations
  - Both tables fully populated and queryable

## ‚ùå WHAT FAILED (But Didn't Break Core Functionality)

### 1. **Metadata Exploration Queries** ‚ùå
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED
- **Error**: `Unrecognized name: row_count`
- **Impact**: Low - just exploratory, didn't affect main pipeline
- **Cause**: BigQuery public datasets don't expose all metadata columns

### 2. **Original Document Creation Query** ‚ùå
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (Fixed in Retry)
- **Error**: `Syntax error: Unclosed string literal`
- **Impact**: Medium - required a corrected version
- **Resolution**: Fixed with proper string escaping in cell #7

### 3. **Advanced ML Model Creation** ‚ùå
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED (Expected)
- **Error**: Connection configuration issues for Vertex AI
- **Impact**: Low - used alternative demo approach successfully
- **Cause**: Requires additional Vertex AI setup and connections

### 4. **Some Statistics Queries** ‚ùå
- **Status**: ‚ùå FAILED
- **Error**: Aggregation errors in embedding statistics
- **Impact**: Low - cosmetic issues in reporting
- **Resolution**: Fixed in later cells
